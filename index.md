Examining the Titanic passenger survival dataset. (Code linked above.)

## [@ARobotLooksAt](https://www.instagram.com/arobotlooksat/): AI art on Instagram

An Instagram account where I post pictures I've produced or altered by machine learning techniques that I'm learning or playing around with. I'm always happy to get suggestions for techniques/toolsets/repos I should check out!

My next goal for the account is to code up a variational autoencoder to generate images.


## [Nomplan.life](http://nomplan.life/): meal planning in Django

A Django site to store and review recipes, plan meals, and develop grocery lists. This is a collaborative project -- my contributions have been most of the major models plus site design, including the very excellent artwork. The site is very slowly being worked on, but very actively being used to plan meals in my household. Next item on the feature wishlist: auto-populating meals for the week, based on meals I've rated highly.

Check out the [code](https://github.com/goobers/themenu) or visit the [deployed site](http://nomplan.life/).
