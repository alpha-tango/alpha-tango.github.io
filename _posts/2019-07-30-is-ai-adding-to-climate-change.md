### Is AI adding to climate change?
That question is discussed in a new article by the MIT Technology Review: [link](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614005/ai-computing-cloud-computing-microchips/)
Some AI companies are saying the projected energy usage of AI will be a big concern -- although improvements in chips and scaling techniques (especially smart ones) may keep the usage growth down.

According to OpenAI, the source of the second picture, "Since 2012, the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.5 month doubling time (by comparison, Moore's Law had an 18 month doubling period."
